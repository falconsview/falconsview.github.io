<h4>Abstract for <i>Making the Horse Drink:</i></h4>
<blockquote>
The old cliche "you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink" represents one of the biggest challenges in computer security. Though security issues are receiving an increasing amount of coverage in the mass media, there still remains the problem of getting system and network administrators to seek out information on security beforeproblems arise. By teaching students and administrators how to proactively continue their education, computer security methods and theories can be made more effective.
