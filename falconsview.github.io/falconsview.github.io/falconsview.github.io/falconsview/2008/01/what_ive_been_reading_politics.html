from Think Progress by Satyam<br />
<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/01/15/huckabee-amend-the-constitution-to-gods-standards/">http://thinkprogress.org/2008/01/15/huckabee-amend-the-constitution-to-gods-standards/</a></p>

<p>How anybody can take this guy seriously, I don't know. He's downright scary, he is.</p>

<p><strong>Citigroup Posts $9.83 Billion Loss and Will Cut Jobs - New York Times</strong><br />
from Google News <br />
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/business/16citi.html?hp">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/business/16citi.html?hp</a></p>

<p>Citigroup has posted a huge loss in a day where the US stock market has taken a beating.</p>

<p><strong>Citigroup raises US$12.5b in fresh capital - Channel News Asia</strong><br />
from Google News <br />
<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_world_business/view/322740/1/.html">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_world_business/view/322740/1/.html</a></p>

<p>Fresh from a $9.83B write-off, it seems only logical that Citigroup would get a fresh round of financing worth $12.5B, putting them ahead almost $3B. Good show! :S</p>

<p><strong>U.S. stocks tumble; Dow industrials drop more than 200 points</strong><br />
from MarketWatch.com - Top Stories <br />
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/story.aspx?guid=%7BFAB3450E%2D8043%2D4AF6%2D9CB5%2DACA872509257%7D&siteid=rss">http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/story.aspx?guid=%7BFAB3450E%2D8043%2D4AF6%2D9CB5%2DACA872509257%7D&siteid=rss</a></p>

<p>More coverage of today's US stock market retreat. Signs of the recession? Methinks so...</p>

<p><strong>Stocks tank on recession fears</strong><br />
from CNN.com <br />
<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/01/15/markets/markets_0100/index.htm?eref=rss_topstories">http://money.cnn.com/2008/01/15/markets/markets_0100/index.htm?eref=rss_topstories</a></p>

<p>And more coverage on the recession as it gets well underway...</p>

<p><strong>Court Limits Shareholder Suits Against Vendors, Banks (Update2) - Bloomberg</strong><br />
from Google News <br />
<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aGjsaJp__bpI&refer=home">http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aGjsaJp__bpI&refer=home</a></p>

<p>In an interesting ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court has limited who shares liability, effectively restricting who shareholders can sue to recoup their losses. This is not welcome news for shareholders, and it clearly puts business in front of individuals. Not what I'd consider a surprising ruling from this panel, though it's unclear at this point the impact it will have. Hopefully Marginal Revolution will post something on this ruling.</p>

<p><strong>Protestors Should be Seen and Heard</strong><br />
from ACLU Blog by blog@aclu.org (Rachel Myers, ACLU)<br />
<a href="http://blog.aclu.org/index.php?/archives/446-Protestors-Should-be-Seen-and-Heard.html">http://blog.aclu.org/index.php?/archives/446-Protestors-Should-be-Seen-and-Heard.html</a></p>

<p>This is just a quick blurb from the ACLU highlighting another case of blatant discrimination and a violation of freedom and free speech by the Bush Administration. Protestors in New Mexico were required to stay back 150 yards from the presidential motorcade, while supporters with a "God Bless George Bush! We Pray for You!" sign were allowed to stand up close. This is a perfect example of how Bush and co. want to only see what they believe to be truth, and not acknowledge reality. No surprise that everyone is disillusioned with this country and its political "leaders."</p>

<p><strong>How to Rig an Election? Ask the Author</strong><br />
from Freakonomics Blog by Melissa Lafsky<br />
<a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/how-to-rig-an-election-ask-the-author/">http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/how-to-rig-an-election-ask-the-author/</a></p>

<p>A first-hand account of how to play dirty (illegal) politics from a convicted criminal turned author. Oh, yeah, he worked for the Republicans. Gee, I'm so shocked... You know the government has too much power when winning elections because such nasty, high-stakes business.</p>

<p><strong>'War on Terror' Allies Form Information Consortium</strong><br />
from Slashdot by Zonk<br />
<a href="http://politics.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/01/15/134259&from=rss">http://politics.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/01/15/134259&from=rss</a></p>

<p>The FBI is leading a consortium of the anti-terror allies, including Canada, the UK, Australia, and NZ, in an information-sharing system. Apparently this DB will hold biometric data (among other things?). As if we didn't feel like we were in enough of a police state already, right? It's kind of scary how this stuff is just quietly put in place, with nobody objecting. If it were implemented by force, I'm sure a rebellion would be at hand.</p>

<p><strong>Fratto’s FISA Fearmongering: In 3 Weeks, Terrorists ‘Can Be Free’ To Make Calls Without Surveillance</strong><br />
from Think Progress by Matt<br />
<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/01/15/fratto-on-fisa/">http://thinkprogress.org/2008/01/15/fratto-on-fisa/</a></p>

<p>Nothing irritates me more than FUD, especially when it's lies, lies, and damn lies. This time, the Bush administration is arguing that the end of the world will arrive in about 3 weeks if FISA isn't renewed and expanded. Nevermind the unconstitutional nature of their plans, or the fact that we have known criminals running the whole program (that's right, those men guilty of high treason in the offices of the President and Vice President - after all, isn't failure to uphold one's oath to the Constitution a betrayal? I think so.). Call your Congressional Representatives and Senators now to express your displeasure.</p>
