<blockquote>
<p>My task at <a href="http://www.anl.gov/">Argonne
National Laboratory</a> in Illinois was to develop an application
to run an X-Ray/CT system. In an X-Ray/CT system, you take side shots
of an object and then reconstruct a view of the image. For example, the
image below was not photographed from above, but was instead scanned
from the side, rotating the image a small degree each time. These side
shots were then combined to produce the below view. The reason that
this can be done is because an X-Ray image shows the density of the
object being scanned. Using complex algorithms, these density graphs
can then be combined to produce a 3D likeness of the image. </p>
<p>The environment that I used for development was LabView
4.01. The camera was an 8-bit Sony CCD. The frame grabber card was a
PCI-IMAQ (image acquisition) card from National Instruments. The
platform was a Pentium 150 with 128MB RAM. The stage was controlled by
a Parker Compumotor system and had four axes of motion. The OS was
Windows 95. </p>
<p>The image reconstruction was handled by existing routines
that had been written in FORTRAN 77 and had been recompiled for the
32-bit OS. </p>
<p>Here is the first composite image that was produced on the
completed system. The object was a plastic composite that had been
produced on a rapid prototype machine. The design is the official ANL
logo. </p>
