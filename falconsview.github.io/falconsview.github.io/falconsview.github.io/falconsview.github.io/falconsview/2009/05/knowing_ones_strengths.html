                              <p>Based on <a href="http://chuvakin.blogspot.com/2009/05/on-strengthsfinder-20-test.html">Anton's recommendation</a>, I picked up a copy of <em><a href="https://www.strengthsfinder.com/">Strengths Finder 2.0</a></em> by Tom Rath. That Anton found it interesting and useful told me that I would probably also appreciate it. My assumption has been proved correct.</p>

<p>Knowing one's strengths and weaknesses is very important, whether it be in competition or personal life or professional life. For me, I know that one of my weaknesses is tending to be somewhat negative, cynical, and sarcastic. This trait, when combined with my tendency toward incessant questioning, can be terribly off-putting. It also, however, can make it difficult for me to see my own strengths. As a good friend of mine has pointed out on numerous equations, life is generally pretty good, if only I'd look at it that way.<br />

                              <p>I took the online assessment, and here's what I found:</p>

<p><strong>My Top 5 Strengths</strong><br />
Strategic<br />
Ideation<br />
Individualization<br />
Communication<br />
Competition</p>

<p>Without getting into too much detail (and potentially violating copyright), here's what this means:</p>

<p> <strong>* Strategic</strong> - I thrive on solving problems, answering questions, innovating, creating, and so on. And, to be quite honest, this is very true. I love to research questions or inkling ideas and generate them into big ideas and breakthroughs. What I'm not very good at - and where I've noticed that I really bog down - is in implementing these big ideas. It seems that I find implementation nothing short of boring, for better or for worse.</p>

<p> <strong>* Ideation</strong> - Similar to the the Strategic trait, I thoroughly enjoy coming up with new ideas and projects. Moreover, I thoroughly enjoy communicating those ideas with others as well as entering into discussion on those ideas, and many other topics.</p>

<p> <strong>* Individualization</strong> - This strength speaks very well to be tendency toward asking lots of questions. I love to dig into the core of everything and everyone. Learning about people fascinates me, both from an interpersonal standpoint as well as from a philosophical and academic perspective. The interesting downside here is that I also tend to spend a lot of time focused on understanding my own failures, which I think correlates strongly with my tendency to be self-critical and self-effacing.</p>

<p> <strong>* Communication</strong> - This strength will come as no surprise to people who know me. If there's one thing I can do, it's communicate. Or over-communicate, as the case may be. In some of my friends, this can drive them completely up the wall. Sorry folks! :)</p>

<p> <strong>* Competition</strong> - The last strength here is interesting to me as my competitiveness is not something I generally keep on the radar. That being said, I certainly look at other people in the industry and think "wow, by my age they've already done X, Y, Z and yet I've only done A." The more that I ruminate about this finding, however, the more it seems to ring true. Analyzing myself in the context of competition provides some interesting insights. I think in many ways this is why Gracie Jiu-Jitsu appeals to me. It requires thinking through things in the face of competition. Until I can best my instructors, I won't feel fully accomplished. :)</p>

<p>I think the good news here is that I've been reminded that I have strengths. I highly recommend this book to others, and hope you'll find out interesting things about yourself, too. What I am now finding most interesting is how I use this information toward understanding the kind of career I would most prefer. It's a wonderful process, learning lots about oneself! :)<br />
